## Bankruptcy Detection
1) The problem I am addressing in this project is to predict the probability of a company going bankrupt using financial data. I have used the Polish companies bankruptcy data, which contains financial data of companies from 2000-2013. The dataset has 10503 instances with 64 features, making it a challenging problem to predict bankruptcy accurately. The objective is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the probability of bankruptcy, thereby assisting investors and companies in making informed decisions.
2) The problem of predicting bankruptcy of companies is a critical task that can help investors make informed decisions about investing in the market. In this project, our goal is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the likelihood of a Polish company going bankrupt based on financial data.
3) The dataset we are using in this project is the Polish companies bankruptcy data, which was collected from Emerging Markets Information Service (EMIS) and contains financial data for 10503 Polish companies. The bankrupt companies were analyzed between 2000 and 2012, while still operating companies were evaluated between 2007 and 2013. The dataset contains 64 features, and the problem is a binary classification problem.
4) My objective is to use various machine learning techniques, including decision trees, support vector machines, and neural networks, to develop a model that can accurately predict the bankruptcy of Polish companies based on the provided financial data. Additionally, I will use feature selection techniques to identify the most important features that contribute to the prediction of bankruptcy
5) The developed model will help investors make informed decisions about investing in the market by providing them with an accurate prediction of the likelihood of a company going bankrupt. This will minimize their risk and help them make better investment decisions. Additionally, the developed model can be used by financial institutions and regulatory bodies to identify companies that are at risk of bankruptcy and take appropriate measures to prevent or mitigate their impact on the economy.
